## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing user behavior metrics such as app usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and more to predict behavior classes and app usage trends.  
The techniques implemented include:

- **Logistic Regression** for classification.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for classification.
- **Linear Regression** for predicting app usage time.

The project also generates five different visualizations for better insight into the data and model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset (`user_behavior_dataset.csv`) contains the following columns:

- **User ID:** Unique identifier for each user.
- **Device Model:** Type of device.
- **Operating System:** OS used by the device.
- **App Usage Time (min/day):** Total time spent using apps.
- **Screen On Time (hours/day):** Total time the screen was on.
- **Battery Drain (mAh/day):** Daily battery consumption.
- **Number of Apps Installed:** Total installed apps.
- **Data Usage (MB/day):** Total data usage per day.
- **Age:** User's age.
- **Gender:** User's gender.
- **Behavior Class:** Target variable indicating user behavior type.

---

## Dependencies

Install the required Python packages before running the code:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Code Details

### Logistic Regression

- **Task:** Classify user behavior using metrics like app usage time, screen-on time, and battery drain.
- **Output:** 
  - Predicted user behavior classes.
  - **Confusion Matrix Plot:** A heatmap visualization of the model's performance.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Task:** Classify user behavior and evaluate the effect of varying the number of neighbors (K).
- **Output:** 
  - Accuracy scores for different values of K.
  - **Accuracy vs. Number of Neighbors Plot:** A line graph showing the impact of K on model accuracy.

### Linear Regression

- **Task:** Predict app usage time based on battery drain.
- **Output:**
  - Predicted app usage times.
  - **Actual vs. Predicted Values Plot:** Scatterplot comparing predictions to actual values.
  - **Residuals Histogram:** Distribution of prediction errors (residuals).

## Visualizations

1. **Confusion Matrix for Logistic Regression**
   - Visualizes true vs. predicted labels for behavior classification.

2. **Accuracy vs. Number of Neighbors for KNN**
   - Shows how the choice of K impacts model accuracy.

3. **Actual vs. Predicted App Usage for Linear Regression**
   - Compares true app usage times to model predictions.

4. **Residuals Histogram for Linear Regression**
   - Displays the distribution of prediction errors.

## How to Run

1. Place the `user_behavior_dataset.csv` file in the same directory as the code.
2. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. The script will:
   - Print dataset correlation and column details.
   - Train Logistic Regression, KNN, and Linear Regression models.
   - Generate visualizations for each model.

4. View the generated plots for insights.
